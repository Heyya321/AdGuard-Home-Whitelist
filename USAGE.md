# Notes 📒

The below information relates to what I personally use and recommend people consider using.

Please assess what is best for you.

# Usage for AdGuard Home 🛡

Check that you are using __AdGuard Home v0.106.3__ or later
(vital functionality was hot-fixed).

## DNS Settings within AdGuard 🥅

I personally use and recommend people consider using Quad9 (https://www.quad9.net/) as their DNS.

Quad9 tops the speed and reliability tests for my location; they offer Malware Blocking, support DNS-over-TLS and also DNSSEC.

They are also now "incorporated in Switzerland to guarantee privacy for global DNS users" (quad9).

* _(optional)_ To test it at your location run the tool: [GRC Domain Name Speed Benchmark for Windows/Linux](https://www.grc.com/dns/benchmark.htm)

### Upstream DNS servers 🔼

tls://dns.quad9.net

### Bootstrap DNS servers 🥾

9.9.9.9

### DNS server configuration ⚙

Check/tick the "Enable DNSSEC" checkbox and click the green __Save__ button.

## Lists 📓

Once you have __AdGuard Home__ ready and are logged in, use its main menu to add
one __blocklists__ and one __allowlist__ (below).

Type | Link (URL)
--------- | -----
📗 Allowlist | [blocklist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hl2guide/AdGuard-Home-Whitelist/main/base.txt)
🛑 Blocklist | [whitelist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hl2guide/AdGuard-Home-Whitelist/main/whitelist.txt)

## Filters Update Interval ⏱

You can modify how often filter lists are updated within AdGuard Home in the
__Settings__ > __General Settings__ page.

Set "Filters update interval" to 12 hours _(recommended)_ and click the green "Save" button.
This list updates around twice per day.

# Browsers 🌏

A mix of Internet Browser Addons/Extensions can improve your security and privacy further.

These are best security and privacy focused internet browser extensions/addons in my opinion.

## Mozilla Firefox Users 🦊

Install using this [collection](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collections/3899969/BestSecurityPrivacy/?page=1&collection_sort=name).

## Microsoft Edge, Brave, Vivaldi and Google Chrome Users 🌐

# Software-Level Firewall 🔥

I personally also use [SimpleWall](https://www.henrypp.org/product/simplewall) to have a baseline protection on an application level.

# Windows 10 Antispy Tool 🕵️‍♀️

If you use Windows 10, please use [O&O ShutUp10](https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10) to disable spying features initially and then after each major update.
